Author: Casey Roulette

This repository contains data and analysis scripts for the study titled "Perceptions of extrinsic mortality, food security, economic effort, mental distress, drug use, and diet among US college students." The data was collected in Fall 2020. A total of 118 participants completed an online Qualtrics survey. A subset of n=51 completed a follow-up telephone interview. Survey instruments included perceptions of extrinsic and intrinsic mortality, food security, Kessler-6 (non-clinical mental distress), among other items.
